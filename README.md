This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Your Task

Build a front end Single Page Application (SPA) using React (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site..

Front End:

Homepage that displays boasts and roasts
buttons to filter the content by either boasts or roasts
upvote and downvote buttons for each boast and roast
ability to sort content based on number of votes
page to submit a boast or a roast
Note: Try to make your React app as simple as possible. We don't need `react-redux` or `react-router` to accomplish our task. Once you get the basic functionality, feel free to extend it if you so desire. The focus of this assessment is not the frontend. We just need one to display the data.
